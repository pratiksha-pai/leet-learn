- when to use l<h vs l<=h
  -   l < h for when solution exists in the array
  -   this will eventually converge to one index
  -   example - search for min in sorted array
-   when to use l <=h
  - when the solution might not exist in the array
  - you need the extra iteration for validating non existence
